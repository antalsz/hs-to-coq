GHC's `Bag` module
==================

This directory contains the translated version of GHC's `Bag.hs` file in
`Bag.v`, and proofs about it in `Proofs.v`.  The translated file is static.

First, you will need to have built the `base` library, in `../ghc-base`; see the
README there for more information.

To compile these proofs, run `Make`
