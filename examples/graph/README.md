This contains a partial translation and verification of Haskell's [Functional Graph Library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl),
which provides inductive definitions of graphs and many graph algorithms. 

Here, the FGL implementations of Breadth-First Search and Disjkstra's algorithm are translated and verified.

The translated files can be found in the lib folder, and the proofs are in theories folder.
